1. I'm working on getting the search component to fully work
2. Since we agreed on username is not unique in our database. I got the search box to return users with the same username as suggestions dropdown below the search box (as professor suggested)
3. User's data is not loading properly when on performing search in the user page (same issue that i got when performing a search on the search page in the last sprint). But got some ideas, gonna try it out to see if it works. Also, cannot import nacl in python for some reason?

1. Working on getting market data from SteamAPI to aggregate into database usable format
2. Finished Proof of Concept for searching items via inventory
3. SteamAPI has a rate limit that is unknown, resulting in lots of denied requests when batch requesting market info. Figuring out a workaround.
