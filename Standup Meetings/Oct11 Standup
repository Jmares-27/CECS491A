2. steam data is returned in json format, can be parsed to update user.

1. I'm working on getting the search component to fully work
2. Since we agreed on username is not unique in our database. I got the search box to return users with the same username as suggestions dropdown below the search box (as professor suggested)
3. User's data is not loading properly when on performing search in the user page (same issue that i got when performing a search on the search page in the last sprint). But got some ideas, gonna try it out to see if it works. Also, cannot import nacl in python for some reason?
