1. Pivoted to display all items in a market setting for the time being, due to unreliability with SteamAPI causing bad loading with specific inventories.
2. Nothing new finished. 
3. We had to pivot due to SteamAPI constantly returning a Response 249 (Too many Requests) when trying to access inventory. For the time being we went with just showing all items via our cached data. We also have a proof of concept repository (owned by me, worked on in conjunction with Nathan) to outline proof of concepts for asynchronous functions on our backend to update our data.

1. Moving away from using DMarket API as we have already had rapid success with bitSkins api. Sadly the DMarket API is unresponsive.
2. Currently I'll be focusing on implementing bitskins api calls.
3. I'll be fixing/improving any pages that call the bitskins API.
