1. Pivoted to display all items in a market setting for the time being, due to unreliability with SteamAPI causing bad loading with specific inventories.
2. Nothing new finished. 
3. We had to pivot due to SteamAPI constantly returning a Response 249 (Too many Requests) when trying to access inventory. For the time being we went with just showing all items via our cached data. We also have a proof of concept repository (owned by me, worked on in conjunction with Nathan) to outline proof of concepts for asynchronous functions on our backend to update our data.
