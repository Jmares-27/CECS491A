1. Working on Inventories for other user pages
2. Finished MyAccount Inventory loading. Some issues with how the data is loaded that I will need to discuss with Nathan
3. Right now loading the Myaccount inventories are super slow, as it needs to find each item one by one in our 21k database. Need to find a faster way to do this.
