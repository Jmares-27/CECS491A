1. Try to find out a way to load data in favorite component without reload the page twice, work with Johnnie to find a way to save steamid to the correct user in our database.
2. Tried couple of methods for both favorite issue and steam login button issue. Some minor changes here and there

1. Working on Dialog Boxes and Pagination onto the Market Page
2. Nothing Changed since last time.
3. Not really an issue, but having to load 21,000 items each time I make a minor change is touching a nerve.
