1. Try to find out a way to load data in favorite component without reload the page twice, work with Johnnie to find a way to save steamid to the correct user in our database.
2. Tried couple of methods for both favorite issue and steam login button issue. Some minor changes here and there
3. Still not able to find a solution for favorite issue and the steamid login button

1. Working on Dialog Boxes and Pagination onto the Market Page
2. Nothing Changed since last time.
3. Not really an issue, but having to load 21,000 items each time I make a minor change is touching a nerve.

1. Separate script to scrape Steam hosted inventory URLs and Steam price
2. Steam URL is scraped for all items, but needs to be further processed and added to database
3. Not all items show when script is run, researching further
