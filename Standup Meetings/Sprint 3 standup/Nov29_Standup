1. Add a pop-up for token expire instead of automatically log user out when their token is invalid/expired, add confirm pop for delete account. Work with Johnnie find a solution to update steamID to the database after successfully login in through steam
2. A perssistent pop-up will appear then token is invalid or expired and the popup will now appear when click on delete now button in delete account component.
3. Still trying to find a way to update steamID to the database after successfully login in through steam
