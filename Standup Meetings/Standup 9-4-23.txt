2. I have managed to get the data (token and the user data) stored in the local storage in form of ( key: token , value: {userdata like username, email, password, etc}   )
3. Still trying to find a way to get the token from the local storage to properly log the user in

I am working on creating a viewable user profile in angular
I have managed to create a single card that will contain a user name, profile pic, and minor information
Stupid picture wonâ€™t get in the little circle
